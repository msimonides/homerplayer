<h2>1. Requirements</h2>

<p>
You need a smartphone or a tablet running the Android 5.0 system or newer.
<br>
You can also run the app on Android 4.3+ and the Kindle Fire tablets but there
will be some <a href="install-full-kiosk.html">limitations when making a dedicated
player</a>.
</p>

<p>
An internet connection is needed during installation but it is not necessary
when listening to audiobooks.
</p>

<h2>2. Install Homer Player</h2>

<p>
Open the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_term%3Dtest"
	onclick="gaLinkClick('Play Store')">Play Store</a> app on your tablet,
search for "Homer Player" and tap "Install".
</p>
<p>
If your tablet doesn't have the Google Play Store (e.g. Kindle Fire), you can
download the installation APK file directly from <a
	href="https://goo.gl/XJhKX7" onclick="gaLinkClick('github releases')">https://goo.gl/XJhKX7</a>.
Open the downloaded file on your phone or tablet to install.
</p>

<h2>3. Open Homer Player</h2>

Text-to-Speech engine selection.
</div>
<p>
The first time you open Homer Player you may be prompted to choose a
Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine. Choose one (Google is a safe bet - this can be
changed later) and tap "Always".
</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is used by Homer Player to read audiobook titles. If it
doesn't work, check the <a
href="faq.html#when-i-browse-books-the-titles-are-not-read-aloud-how-do-i-fix-it">FAQ</a> for help.</p>

<h2>4. Play with the app</h2>
<p>
You can download sample audiobook excerpts from within the app so that you can
start testing it right away.
</p>

<p>
Play, pause, swipe left and right to change books, test flip-to-stop and <a
  href="features.html">other features</a>, tap the screen 5 times (while
paused) to enter settings.
</p>

<h2>5. Copy your audiobooks to the device</h2>

<p>First prepare the audiobooks on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The books must be in the form of MP3 files (DRM-free). You can get them
from <a href="faq.html#where-do-i-get-books-to-listen-to-with-homer-player"
onclick="gaLinkClick('FAQ getting-books')">stores and libraries (either online
downloads or on CDs)</a>.
<li>Each audiobook needs to be in its own folder. The folder name should be the
book title (it is displayed and read by the player).
<li>The files will be played in alphabetic order.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Then copy the folders with audiobooks to the tablet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the tablet to your Mac or PC with a USB cable. If you're using a
Mac, you may need the <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/">Android
file transfer tool</a>.
<li>Copy your audiobooks to the tablet. Create a folder to put all audiobooks
in the tablet's storage, e.g. <code>Audiobooks</code> (there may already be
one). Put each audiobook in its own folder inside this main one. The folder
name will be displayed and read as the book title.
<li>Open Homer Player, tap 5 times to open settings and choose "Audiobook
folders" (if you haven't installed samples, just tap "Choose audiobooks
folder"). Navigate to the <code>Audiobooks<code> folder you created earlier
and select it.
<li>Go back, the app should now list your books.
</ol>
