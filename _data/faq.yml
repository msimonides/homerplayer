    - question: Is it necessary to purchase an Android tablet to try the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        No, you can install the application on any smartphone or tablet with Android
        4.2 or newer. You can also ask a friend who has an Android phone to install it so
        you can test it. The app can then be removed in a matter of seconds (like any
        other app).
        </p>
        <p>
        If there is absolutely no way for you to have access to an Android device you
        can install an app player on your PC or Mac, for example <a
        href="http://www.bluestacks.com">Bluestacks</a>.
        </p>

    - question: Does the app work with Kindle Fire
      answer: >
        <h3>The short answer</h3>
        <p>
        Kindle Fire tablets are good to test the app, however they are not
        well suited for making a dedicated Homer Player device.
        </p>
        <h3>The long answer:</h3>
        <p>
        Kindle Fire tablets are Android devices and as such should run all or
        almost Android apps. So if you own a Kindle Fire and want to test
        Homer Player, go ahead. Homer Player is not published in the Amazon
        Appstore but you can download the newest APK installation package from
        here: <a href="https://goo.gl/XJhKX7">https://goo.gl/XJhKX7</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        However, while all the playback functions work fine, Kindle Fire
        tablets have two limitations that make them unsuitable for making a
        dedicated audiobook player:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>the <a href="install-full-kiosk.html">full kiosk mode</a> is not
        supported, only the simple kiosk mode is available,
        <li>it isn't possible to disable the lock screen - even with all
        security lock options disabled the user needs to swipe
        the screen to use any apps.
        </ul>
        <p>These limitations may be acceptable to some users.</p>
        <p>
        <em>Ths information is based on a 5th generation Kindle 7 and might be
        inaccurate for newer devices. Kindle Fires are not available where I
        live so it's difficult to borrow a newer one for testing.</em>
        </p>

    - question: Is it necessary for the user to have WiFi or Internet connection after installing the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        No. Internet connection is not necessary for running the application. The
        books are transferred from a computer over a USB cable so the device
        works more or less like any portable audio player.
        </p>
        <p>
        In fact I encourage disabling WiFi when "building" a dedicated player so that
        it lasts longer on a single battery charge.
        </p>

    - question: I would like to make a Homer Player tablet but will I be able to do this with a Mac?
      answer: >
        <p>Yes, you can use a Mac or a PC with Windows or Linux.</p>

    - question: How can I start a book from the beginning? While I was testing the book advanced 10 minutes and now I want it to play from start when I give the tablet to my uncle.
      answer: >
        <p>There is a function to reset progress on <strong>all</strong> audiobooks to the beginning.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Start Homer Player.
        <li>Tap the screen 5 times to open Settings.
        <li>Choose "Rewind all books to the beginningâ€¦" and then confirm.
        </ol>

    - question: Can I put the audiobook files on a microSD card in the device?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Yes. When you set up the app you need to select one or more folders
        with audiobooks - the folders can be on an installed SD card.
        </p>
        <p>
        To add or remove audiobook folders tap the main Homer Player screen 5 times to
        open settings and then choose "Audiobooks folders".
        </p>

- section: Audiobooks compatibility
  questions:
    - question: What audiobook formats are supported?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Homer Player supports DRM-free MP3 files.<br>
        Each book may comprise of a number of files that are played in alphabetical
        order. The files may also be nested in subdirectories (useful when copying
        books that come on multiple CDs).
        </p>
        <p>
        This means that most audiobooks thay you <strong>buy</strong> will
        work fine.<br>
        However, subscription and rental services that only work with their
        dedicated application are unlikely to work.
        </p>

    - question: Where do I get books to listen to with Homer Player?
      answer: >
        <p>
        There should be a number of sources available to you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Stores: you can buy books in MP3 for download or on CDs from many
            internet stores like
            <a href="http://audiobookstore.com">audiobookstore.com</a> or
            <a href="http://www.downpour.com">Downpour</a>
            (you probably know the best ones in your country).<br>
            Look for DRM-free MP3 downloads.</li>
        <li>Libraries: it's often possible to borrow audiobooks at the local
            library.</li>
        <li>Free classics: there are many services and non-profit projects that
            provide free audiobooks (mostly classics).<br>
            Here are a few that provide books in English:
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://freeclassicaudiobooks.com/">FreeClassicAudioBooks.com</a>
            <li><a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a>
            <li><a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/">Lit2Go</a>
                (go to each chapter to download it in an MP3 file).
            </ul>
        </ul>

    - question: Can I use audiobooks from Audible?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Unfortunately subscription services like Audible are not supported and they
        don't provide MP3 files for download.
        </p>
        <p>See the previous question on some tips where to get books.</b>

- section: Troubleshooting
  questions:
    - question: When I browse books, the titles are not read aloud. How do I fix it?
      answer: >
        <p>The Text-to-Speech (TTS) module isn't working correctly.<br>
        There may be a number of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>voice data for your language is not installed,
        <li>your language is not supported by your TTS module,
        <li>no TTS is installed on your device.
        </ul>

        <p>Go to <strong>Settings &rarr; Language &amp; input &rarr;
        Text-to-speech output</strong><br>
        Here you can choose the preferred engine, change its settings (e.g.
        download more voices) and play an example sentence.</p>

        <img src="img/tts-settings.png" class="img-responsive center-block single-screenshot">

        <p>Most devices come with the Google Text-to-Speech Engine installed.
        It supports a number of popular languages. If your language is missing
        (or you don't like the voice) you can install other TTS engines from
        the Play Store.<br>
        One engine with a large number of supported languages is Vocalizer (paid). You
        can also find TTS apps for specific languages.<p>

    - question: Copying books to the device doesn't work or aborts during the process.
      answer: >
        <p>
        A small number of users have reported issues with copying files to their devices.
        Here are a few things to try:
        <ul>
        <li>disable the kiosk mode for the time of copying files,
        <li>if the device doesn't show up in your computer after it is
        connected, swipe down the top of the screen (with kiosk mode disabled). There
        should be a notification about the USB connection. If it says "USB for
        charging" then tap it and choose "Transfer files".
        <li>if copying stops at a certain moment, try keeping the screen on
        until all files are copied.
        </ul>
        </p>

    - question: I want to disable screen lock on my device but the "None" option is not available.
      answer: >
        <p>There may be a numbr of reasons for the <strong>None</strong> option to not be
        available.</p>
        <p>
        The most common is that there is more than one account set up on the device, usually
        a guest account. Delete the account to bring back the "None" screen lock option.
        </p>
        <p>
        Removing a user account differs slightly between devices, but usually one needs
        to switch to the account to delete, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr;
        <strong>Users</strong> and remove the current account.<br>
        If you need more specific information for your device Google for: <a

    - question: How can I help with the project?
      answer: >
        <p>There's a number of ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:marcin@studio4plus.com">send me your feedback</a> so
        that I know what needs improvement,
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer" target="_blank">rate the app</a> to make it easier to find by others,
        <li>translate the Google Play Store description to your language, it's just a
        few paragraphs long and may help others learn about the app (<a

    - question: Can I donate money to the project?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Thank you, but there is no need. The project doesn't require much funds, it
        mostly needs my time and motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want to show your appreciation the best way is to send me a postcard from
